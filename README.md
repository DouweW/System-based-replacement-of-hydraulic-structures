# System-based-replacement-of-hydraulic-structures

This folder contains the SD model (VENSIM), EMA calculations-, postprocessing- and visualization files.
First the Base Ensemble is simulated by running the Base Ensemble python files, thereafter the Policy files are run.

Process:
1. Run the calculation file (Takes approximately 36 hours, base ensemble results are added to Result folder. File size of Policy results is unfortunately too large to upload)
2. Run the postprocess file
3. Run the analysis file
